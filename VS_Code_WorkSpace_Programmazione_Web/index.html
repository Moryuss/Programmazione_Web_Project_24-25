        A very simple example of a website created during the Web Programming
        and Digital Services course. The site lists the books I am currently
        reading or have read, along with the list of authors who have populated
        my readings and imagination. The website will continue to grow during
        this semester, completing itself gradually thanks to the implementation
        of web technologies that will be introduced in the course. Enjoy!
